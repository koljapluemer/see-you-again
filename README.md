# Obsidian: See You Again

1. Add **usage contexts** to your notes
2. See your notes again just when you need them

## Installation

## Context

## Usage 

I recommend using the command `Manage contexts for currently open note` (access the command menu with `Ctrl`/`Cmd` + `P`). You can also click the "tags" icon in the sidebar.

---

If you give note a *usage context*, you also give it an *action*. An "action" is what you are supposed to do with the note if it comes up in this context. There are the following five possibilities:

- `look-at` (doing nothing)
- `iterate` (do an action; improve; get done)
- `memorize` (practice this note as a flashcard)
- `evaluate` (notes that are a question that you interactively answer)
- `schedule` (bigger habits where you set an implementation intention)


---

I may create the following note:

```
ðŸ“– A Psalm for the Wild-Built.md
```

```
---
see-you-again:
  daily: iterate
  when-i-want-to-re-read-fiction: look-at
  when-i-get-asked-for-wholesome-books: look-at
---

* Author: [[Becky Chambers]]
```

This will achieve the following:
- in the `daily` context (which I have a habit of looking at every day), I `iterate` this book (i.e. read it for a bit)
- when I'm asked for nice-to-read book recommendations, I can start the `when-i-get-asked-for-wholesome-books` context and this will come up randomly
- when I'm in the mood to re-read a book I previously enjoyed, I can start the `when-i-want-to-re-read-fiction` context and this will come up randomly

---

Here is another example:

```
are you satisfied with the amount of exercise done in the last 24 hoursï¹–.md
```
```
---
see-you-again:
  end-of-month: iterate
  daily: evaluate
---
```
This will achieve the following:
- `everyday`, I will `evaluate` (= write a short text answer) on whether or not I am satisified with the amount of exercise I'm doing
- at the end of the month, this note will sometimes come up randomly and I can rethink the habit, rephrase the question, think about ideas to do better, etc.
